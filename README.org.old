   collections of coordinated multimethods that can be specialized to
   adjust the behavior of the library.

   A minimal web-framework for CL that wraps Fukamachi's ningle.
   Built around a set of multimethods to separate getting the data for
   a view from the actual view.  Because of the multimethods, classes
   can be used to drive different views for different situations.
